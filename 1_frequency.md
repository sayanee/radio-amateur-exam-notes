# 1. Frequency

## Definitions

- **Frequency**: The number of complete cycles that occur in each second
- **Cycles** are complete vibrations
- **Wavelength** is the length of each cycle

## Units of measurement

- `Hertz` or `Hz`: cycles per `second`

Working with big numbers

| Symbol  | Name | Multiplication by | Amount | Power of 10 |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |---
| `p`  | pico | 0.000000000001  | trillionth | -12
| `n`  | nano | 0.000000001  | billionth | -9
| `µ`  | micro | 0.000001  | millionth | -6
| `m`  | milli | 0.001  | thousandth | -3
| `K`  | kilo | 1,000  | thousand | 3
| `M`  | mega | 1,000,000  | million | 6
| `G`  | giga | 1,000,000,000  | billion | 9
| `T`  | tera | 1,000,000,000,000  | trillion | 12

## Formula

- `v = fλ` where `v` is speed of light, `f` is frequency, `λ` is wavelength

## Examples of frequencies

- public electricity supply: `50 Hz`
- BBC transmission on FM (SG): `88.9 MHz`
- Middle `A` on a piano: `440 Hz`
- heart beats: `1 Hz`
- spin dryer rotation: `16.6 Hz`
- Human ear can hear up to `20 kHz`

## Notes

### Frequency Spectrum

- Sound → Radio → Heat → Infra-red → Light → Ultra-violet → X-Ray (↑ frequency)
- Useful radio frequencies range from about `10 KHz` to beyond `30 GHz`
- Each part of the radio frequency spectrum has its own characteristics
- Only a small range of frequencies are suitable for certain popular activities
- Frequencies that are capable of traveling around the world are subjected to world wide controls
- *approximate* lower band edge frequency of each amateur band up to `3400 MHz`
- Most radio amateurs refer to their bands in terms of wavelength, e.g. `20 meters`

Other services using the radio spectrum: *Shipping, Aircraft, Military, Citizens Band, Navigation, Public Services, Telecommunications, Weather Services, Remote Control, Security Systems and Satellites*

| | Wavelength range | Frequency range  | Name | Amateur bands | Uses
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
| 1 | `10 km` – `1 km`| `30 kHz` – `300 kHz`  | `LF` (Low frequency)  | None | Low
| 2 | `1 km` – `100 m`| `300` – `3 MHz`  | `MF` (Medium frequency)  | `1.8 MHz` (`160m`) | Amateur Radio, AM Broadcasting (not as common now)
| 3 |` 100 m` – `10 m`| `3 MHz` - `30 MHz` | `HF` (High frequency)  | `3.5 MHz` (`80m`) <br> `7 MHz` (`40m`) <br> `10 MHz` (`30m`) <br> `14 MHz` (`20m`) <br> `18 MHz` <br> `21 MHz` <br> `24 MHz` <br> `28 MHz` | Broadcast short wave bands, Amateur Radio
| 4 | `10 m` - `1 m`| `30 MHz` - `300 MHz` | `VHF` (Very high frequency)  | `144 MHz `  | Broadcast (FM, TV), Amateur Radio
| 5 |`1 m` - `100 mm` | `300 MHz` - `3 GHz` | `UHF` (Ultra high frequency)  | `430 MHz`(`70cm`)| Amateur Radio, Microwave ovens, television, WiFi
| 6 | `<100mm` | above `3000 MHz` | `SHF` (Super high frequency)  |  | Radio astronomy, microwave devices, WiFi, radar |

Challenges in hearing a station due to:

- frequency
- time of day
- season
- sunspot
- noise/inteference

*Public broadcasting services transmits the same program several times on a selection of frequencies in order to obtain world wide coverage*
